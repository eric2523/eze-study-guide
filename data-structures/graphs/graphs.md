# Graphs
A **graph** is **any** collection of nodes and edges 
* an **edge** is anything that connects a node 
A graph is much more relaxed than other types of trees such that it may:
* lack a root node
* have cycles (e.g. child points back to root node)
  * i.e. can be a multidirectional tree
* have any number edges leaving a node (i.e. one node can point to 0..Inifnity other nodes)
