# Heaps 
A **heap** is a partially ordered data structure that can be visualized as a BST. One difference is that it is not fully ordered like BSTs and is usually implemented using an array. 

## Max Heap
Invariant (fancy word for "never changing"): Given any node, its children must be less than or equal to the node.
